# Asteroid Blizzard
Asteroid Blizzard is a space game unlike any other... you are a crazy pilot trying to crash into as many asteroids as possible with your super strong ship. You change direction with either a, w, s, d or the arrow keys. You accelerate with space bar and decelerate with b. The more Asteroids you crash into, the more points you get!
